<html><h2><u><center>Elastic File System</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> If you want to create common storage between two or more than two EC2 instances/machines and all of them can access it, read and write the data in the same region but 
   different AZ. For these kind of storage EFS has been made. 
-> As EFS would be in the same region, between different AZ. You need to select different subnets and have EC2 instance running in those subnets. So, those can access EFS.

Note: 1. EFS is only for linux operating system not for windows.
      2. It's not available for all the region.

Step by step EFS setup
1. Type elastic file system or “EFS” in the search box, select the EFS option from the dropdown.
2. Click on the “Create file system” button on your right-hand side, that brings the the popup.
3. Give a name to your file system and select the VPC from the drop-down.

5. If you want to check the detail of the file system just click either on fileName or File system ID.
Note:- As a management console user we need notice one important thing when creating EC2 instance “Add file System” button is disable by default when you don’t have any EFS file system.
6. It’s time to attached EFS to an EC2 instance, for this test we need ec2 instances. Create EC2 instance using previously created EFS file system in the Configure Instance selection.
   Set Availability Zone, add Storage and tags. Finally set Configure Security Group and click Review and Launch.
7. It’s Done. Now check the mounted file system on the ec2 instance. Change directory from root to mnt/efs/fsl
8. Mount EFS file system on an existing EC2 instance. Connect to EC2 instance and create following directory structure under /mnt folder.
sudo mkdir efs
cd efs
sudo mkdir fs2
9. Open the previously created EFS file system in the management console and click on the Attach button on the upper right-hand side. Under the following popup select Mount via DNS option and select EFS mount helper.
10. Run the following command on the terminal
sudo mount -t efs -o tls file-system-id:/ /mnt/efs/fs2 (use your id here)
11. Now it’s time to check the mounted EFS file system for the instance using the Disk Free tool or mount command.
sudo df -h
